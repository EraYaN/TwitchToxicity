\chapter{Results}
\label{ch:results}

The results will give a degree of toxicity to a certain stream of a streamer and to individual users that are present in the chat.
Where 1 is non-toxic and 5 is very toxic.
With these values we can make a conclusion if a streamer is toxic, by comparing all off his/her streams, or if a certain user is toxic, by comparing his toxicity degree between multiple streams.
