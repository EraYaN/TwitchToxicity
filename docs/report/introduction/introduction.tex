This project researches the toxicity in twitch streamer communities.
It is a well known problem in online gaming that users exert toxic behaviour to their teammates or the enemy team when things do not go as they want to.
Companies use their own detection algorithms to track and punish these toxic users accordingly.
This project focues on the well known streamer site twitch.tv, which enables users and companies to broadcast their gameplay or tournaments.
A dataset was scraped from twitch and analyzed for toxic behaviour by the viewers of popular streamers.
These streamers play well known games like League of Legends, CS:GO and Dota 2.
The influence of the streamer behaviour on its viewers and vice versa was analyzed to see if toxicity can be passed from viewers to the streamer or the other way around.
