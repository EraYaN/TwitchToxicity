\chapter{Analysis}
\label{ch:analysis}

This section describes how the data that was gathered in the previous steps will be analysed using the proper tools. The main goal is to see whether certain toxic users are only toxic when they are viewing a certain streamer or in every channel they visit. So whether viewers match their toxicity level to the channel. Another interesting question is to see if certain are more toxic than other channels and how this affects the toxicity levels of the users.
